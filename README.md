# Parallax Auto Layout Demo

This Xcode project shows how to add a `tableHeaderView` to a `UITableView` with the popular parallax effect   using Auto Layout.

The requires Xcode 7 and Swift 2.0 to run.

I didn't include code to deal with landscape vs. portrait images, so if you're implementing this using portrait images, you may have to tweak it to achieve the effect you want. Let me know via a Github issue if you would like to see some more examples added.
